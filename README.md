## CQF Program Content

### Module One: Building Blocks of Quantative Finance

"In module one, we will introduce you to the rules of applied Itô calculus
as a modeling framework. You will build tools using stochastic calculus and martingale theory and learn how to use simple stochastic differential equations and their associated Fokker-Planck and Kolmogorov
equations.”

- Random behavior of assets
- Important mathematical tools and results 
- Taylor series 
- Partial differential equations 
- Transition density functions 
- Fokker-Plank and Kolmogorov 
- Stockhastic calculus and Itô’sLemma 
- Manipulating stochastic differential equations 
- Martingales 
- The binomial model for asset prices 

### Module Two: Quantitative Risk and Return

In module two, you will learn aboutthe classical portfolio theory ofMarkowitz, the capital asset pricingmodel, and the recent developmentsof these theories. We will investigatequantitative risk and return, lookingat econometric models such asthe ARCH framework and riskmanagement metrics such as VaR andhow they are used in the industry.

- Modern portfolio theory 
- Capital asset pricing model 
- Portfolio optimization for portfolio selection 
- Risk regualtion and Basel III 
- Value at risk and expected shortfall 
- Collateral and margins 
- Liquidity aseet liability management 
- Volatility filtering (GARCH Family)
- Asset returns : key, empirical stylized facts 
- Volatilty models: The ARCH Framework 

### Module Three: Equities and Currencies 

In module three, we will explore theimportance of the Black-Scholestheory as a theoretical and practicalpricing model, which is built on theprinciples of delta heading and noarbitrage. You will learn about thetheory and results in the contextof equities and currencies usingdifferent kinds of mathematics tomake you familiar with techniques incurrent use.

- The Black-Scholes Model 
- Hedging and the Greeks 
- Options strategies 
- Early ecercise and American options 
- Finite-difference and methods 
- Monte Carlo simulations 
- Exotic options 
- Volatility arbitrage strategies 
- Martingale theory for pricing 
- Girsanov’s theorem 
- Advanced Greeks 
- Derivatives market practice 
- Advanced volatility modeling in complete markets 
- Non-probabilistic volatility models 
- FX Options 

### Module Four: Data Science and Machine Learning I

In module four, you will beintroduced to the latest data scienceand machine learning techniquesused in finance. Starting with acomprehensive overview of thetopic, you will learn essentialmathematical tools, followed by adeep dive into supervised learning,including regression methods,k-nearest neighbors, support vectormachines, ensemble methods, andmany more. 

- What is mathematical modeling? 
- Math toolbox for machine learning

- Penalized regressions: lasso, ridge, and elastic net
- Logistic, SoftMax regression
- K-nearest neighbors 
- Naive bayes classifier 
- Super vector machines 
- Decision tress 
- Ensemble models - bagging and boosting 
- Python - scikit learn

### Module Four: Data Science and Machine Learning II

In module five, you will learn severalmore methods used for machinelearning in finance. Starting withunsupervised learning, deep learningand neural networks, we will moveinto natural language processingand reinforcement learning. You willstudy the theoretical framework, butmore importantly, analyze practicalcase studies exploring how thesetechniques are used within finance.

- Unsupervised learning techniques 
- K-means clustering

- AI-based algo trading strategies 
- Quantum computing in finance
- Python - TensorFlow

### Module Six: Fixed Income and Credit

In the first part of module six, we willreview the multitude of interest ratemodels used within the industry,focusing on the implementation andlimitations of each model. In thesecond part, you will learn aboutcredit and how credit risk modelsare used in quant finance, includingstructural, reduced form, as well ascopula models.

- Fixed-income products and market practices 
- Yield, duration, and convexity 
- Stochastic interest rate models
